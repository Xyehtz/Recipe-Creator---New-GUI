## Project Description

Recipe Picker is an app created on Python and based on a tutorial from YouTube, from the channel "Python Simplified" (YouTube Channel: ***https://www.youtube.com/@PythonSimplified***) this simple app gives the user random recipes with just one click, giving the user full and detailed information about the recipe, mainly the ingredients of it, here is an example image of the app:

### Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies and packages, you can find a file with all the packages used in this project on the main branch.

`Customtkinter`: This is the main package used on this project and is in charge of everything related to the GUI, in this project I use `Customtkinter` because of it's similarity with the normal `Tkinter`, and also because of it's modern interfrace which makes the GUI feel more advanced and clean in comparision with the normal `Tkinter`.

`PIL`: `PIL` or `Python Imaging Library` is the package that I used in this project to be able to load all the images used on the application.

`SQLite3`: This database is used to store all the information of the recipes such as recipes names, ingredients, quantity and unit, while keeping it organized so that it can be easily modified.

`Numpy`: Used for randomly selecting the recipes.

`sys` and `os`: To obtain all the resources used, this could be images, fonts and the database.

`Pyglet`: To easily add and load custom fonts on the app.

`Pyinstaller`: To create the .exe file of the app and used it on different devices.
